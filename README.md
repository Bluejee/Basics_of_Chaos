# Basics of Chaos

This repository contains all the programs, results, and the comprehensive report of my Bachelor's Thesis titled "Chaos - Interpreting the Physical Pendulum and the Chaotic Ratchet" conducted during the 3rd year of my Integrated Masters. The project focuses on exploring Non-linearity and Chaos within dynamical systems, particularly analyzing two key systems: a physical pendulum and the chaotic ratchet.

## Abstract
In this study, we delve into the complex world of Non-linearity and Chaos. Our investigation begins with an interpretation of nonlinear systems, followed by a discussion on various representation methods such as Space-Time diagrams and Phase Space Diagrams. We explore the numerical solutions to differential equations that are typically unsolvable through analytical methods. The journey from order to disorder in systems, and the potential return to order, is examined. Key concepts like bifurcation diagrams and Poincar√© sections of Phase Space Diagrams are discussed to identify attractors and understand the 'order in chaos'. This leads to applying these concepts to a Chaotic Ratchet system, unveiling the intriguing notion of negative currents. The study sets a foundation for future research into using entropy as a measure of chaos and predicting the behavior of chaotic systems.

## Systems Analyzed
1. **Physical Pendulum**: An investigation into its dynamic behavior and underlying chaotic properties.
2. **Chaotic Ratchet**: Analysis of this unique system, focusing on the phenomenon of negative currents.

## Key Findings
- **Order to Chaos**: Understanding the progression of systems from orderly to chaotic states.
- **Chaos in Physical Systems**: Applying theoretical knowledge to real-world systems, with a focus on chaotic ratchets.
- **Entropy and Chaos**: Preliminary insights into using entropy as a chaos metric and predictive tool.

## Note on Programs
The programs in this repository have not undergone linting, refactoring, or extensive commenting. This setup, established a few years after the project's completion, is intended primarily for reference purposes. Due to the time-consuming nature of refactoring and reorganizing legacy code, the programs are provided as-is. They should be viewed as a conceptual reference rather than a ready-to-use codebase.

## Repository Structure
- `programs_results/`: Contains all the codes written and the results produced as part of this research.
- `documents/`: The comprehensive report detailing the study, and a presentation including the latex code that was used to make the report.
